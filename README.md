# Combine Improvements

A set of improvements for Combine Factions in hl2rp the list of features include:
- Citizen/Unit Manifest; this shows all currently active units as well as citizens.
- New View Data; A new view data command and panel, the view data command only allows for someone to read and not edit data.
- Terminals; 3 new terminals have been added, MPF (For viewing citizen data with write access), Citizen Terminal (For citizens to view basic data about themselves), Command Terminal (Access to edit Civil Protection Unit's ranks and change sociostatus)
- Sociostatus and BOL; A simple Sociostatus system which can be customised very easily, along with a BOL system for tracking citizen's with a BOL
- Biosignals; Simple biosignals along with a simple option to edit whether or not biosignals can be seen anywhere
- HUD info; Adds in some simple HUD display tooltips shown on both Citizens and Combine assets, this includes info such as rank, CID, etc.
- New CID item; Adds in a simple CID item which can be made into a workers card by a Civil Protection Unit
- And some more that I have either forgotten about or was not noteworthy enough to add

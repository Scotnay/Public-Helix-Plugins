# Combine Improvements V2

this is less of an updated version of Combine Improvements but instead a full on rewrite of the entire plugin. I wrote this plugin a while back and decided since I don't do Garry's mod stuff all that much anymore that I might as well release it so people have something better to use than my other buggy mess. Most of the features are the same but the citizen terminal was removed and a lot of the visuals were revamped. If you are already using Combine Improvements there is little to no backwards compatability from what I remember so if you are going to use this plugin then expect to have to redo how your server works in terms of running Combine.

# Sanity
Sanity is a simple system I wrote because I wanted to add some more random elements to the roleplay experience. It didn't turn out exactly as I wanted it to but I thought I'd release this semi-wip version for people to be able to use and modify if they so desire.

# Combine Improvements

WARNING:
This plugin is pretty broken as it was one of my first releases, I am keeping it here for archival reasons but I do not recommend the use of this plugin.

A set of improvements for Combine Factions in hl2rp the list of features include:
- Citizen/Unit Manifest; this shows all currently active units as well as citizens.
- New View Data; A new view data command and panel, the view data command only allows for someone to read and not edit data.
- Terminals; 3 new terminals have been added, MPF (For viewing citizen data with write access), Citizen Terminal (For citizens to view basic data about themselves), Command Terminal (Access to edit Civil Protection Unit's ranks and change sociostatus)
- Sociostatus and BOL; A simple Sociostatus system which can be customised very easily, along with a BOL system for tracking citizen's with a BOL
- Biosignals; Simple biosignals along with a simple option to edit whether or not biosignals can be seen anywhere
- HUD info; Adds in some simple HUD display tooltips shown on both Citizens and Combine assets, this includes info such as rank, CID, etc.
- New CID item; Adds in a simple CID item which can be made into a workers card by a Civil Protection Unit
- And some more that I have either forgotten about or was not noteworthy enough to add
